# ComfyUI Image Tiled Nodes

Custom nodes for ComfyUI that allow splitting large images into overlapping tiles for processing (e.g., Inpainting/Upscaling) and merging them back seamlessly with feathering blending.

## Features

*   **Split Large Images**: Split a large image into smaller tiles suitable for diffusion models.
*   **Seamless Blending**: Automatically generates feathered masks for tile edges to ensure seamless merging after processing.
*   **Batch Processing**: Outputs tiles as a batch, allowing standard ComfyUI nodes (`VAE Encode`, `KSampler`, etc.) to process all tiles at once without complex loop structures.
*   **Flexible Configuration**: Customizable tile size, overlap amount, and feathering ratio.

## Installation

1.  Navigate to your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` directory.
2.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tuki0918/comfyui-image-tiled-nodes.git
    ```
3.  Restart ComfyUI.

## Nodes

### Tiled Image Splitter

Splits an input image into tiles.

*   **Inputs**:
    *   `image`: The source image to split.
    *   `tile_width` / `tile_height`: The size of each tile.
    *   `overlap`: The size of the overlapping area between tiles (in pixels).
    *   `feather_ratio`: Ratio of the overlap area to use for feathering/blending (0.0 - 0.5).
*   **Outputs**:
    *   `tiles`: A batch of cropped images.
    *   `masks`: A batch of masks corresponding to the tiles. Edges are feathered for seamless blending.
    *   `tile_info`: Metadata required by the Merger node to reconstruct the image.

### Tiled Image Merger

Merges the processed tiles back into a single large image.

*   **Inputs**:
    *   `images`: A batch of processed tile images (usually from `VAE Decode`).
    *   `tile_info`: The metadata output from the **Tiled Image Splitter** node.
*   **Outputs**:
    *   `image`: The final merged image.

## Workflow Example

1.  **Load Image** -> Connect to **Tiled Image Splitter** (`image`).
2.  **Tiled Image Splitter** (`tiles`) -> **VAE Encode** -> **KSampler** ...
3.  **Tiled Image Splitter** (`masks`) -> **Set Latent Noise Mask** (for Inpainting).
4.  **Tiled Image Splitter** (`tile_info`) -> Connect to **Tiled Image Merger** (`tile_info`).
5.  **KSampler** -> **VAE Decode** -> Connect to **Tiled Image Merger** (`images`).
6.  **Tiled Image Merger** (`image`) -> **Save Image**.

This setup processes all tiles in a single batch run. Ensure your VRAM is sufficient for the number of tiles generated.
